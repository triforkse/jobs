## Software Developer


### About you

- **Agile mindset.** You favor working in small autonomous teams where you can impact the course of action.
- **A driving force.** You are not afraid of driving a topic for the benefit of yourself and the team.
- **People over process.** You believe in communications with your peers to reach a collective goal.
- **Curiousity.** You love exploring, learning and sharing new technology.
- **Problem solver.** You are someone who aren't afraid of solving a problem outside your main area of expertize.

### About us

- **Projects.** We work in-house with external projects for our customers. No consulting, body-shopping. We do several projects per year.
- **Teambased development.** We choose the right technology based on project demands and team decisions.
- **Work life balance.** We are very aware that you have a life outside of work and that your family comes first.
- **Pair programming.** We believe that two pairs of hands are better than one, and the quality of the code is more impotant that the quantity!
- **Interest groups.** We take time every week to work on side projects, like e.g. a DevOps Interest Group working on Docker Swarm servers and monitoring systems.

As an employee at Trifork you will be able to influence which tools, programming languages, and technologies you work with. 
We have worked with Clojure, ClojureScript, Elixir, Elm, Scala, Java, JavaScript, Riak, Datomic, PostgreSQL and many other new and interesting technologies. We are very good at web development, and working with Webpack and ReactJS has been the technology of choice for our single-page web apps.

You will also join for our annual ski-trip to the Alps and our international developer conferences with over 5000 annual attendees. If you wish you can even become part of our Conference Program Committee, where you help choose topics and speakers for our GOTO Developer Conferences across the world (http://gotosthlm.com/).
