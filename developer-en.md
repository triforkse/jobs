## Requirements

We are looking for a developer with an academic background and at least a few years of professional programming experience.

## What to expect working at Trifork

- A normal project will last on average 4 months, some run for years, but you always get to influence what project you work on.
- We are very aware that you have a life outside of work and that your family comes first.

The majority of our time we spend working in pairs, we believe that two pairs of are better than one, and the quality of the
code is more impotant that the quantity!

We are firm belivers that functional programming is a big part of the future, so if you have an interest in FP, that
is very welcome and encuraged.

We have interest groups, that every week use some time to work on side projects, like e.g. a DevOps Interest Group working on Docker Swarm servers and monitoring systems.
