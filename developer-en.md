# Developer

Stockholm

Do you love programming and do you call yourself a geek? Do you like challenges? Do you like to share your knowledge? Do you feel comfortable being responsible for technical choices? Then we would like to talk to you!

We are a growing team in an beautiful office in the center of Stockholm. To work with us feels like being in a startup, but we are part of a big international company with stable finances. We usually do project based development with projects ranging on average 2-3 months. Here you have a chance to participate in bleeding edge R&D projects. We believe in everybody's need to have flexibility to have a great work life as well as personal life.

We encourage choosing the right tool for the job. We believe in, or have worked with, Clojure, ClojureScript, Elixir, Haskell, Elm, Scala, Java, Groovy, JavaScript...

We are looking for somebody with academic background or equivalent, several years of professional experience...
